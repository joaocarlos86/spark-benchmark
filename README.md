# Apache Spark Playground

This is a space where I'm going to publish the code that I'm using to perform benchmark tests using Spark. The rough idea is to have a view on how to numbers behave when Spark cames to handle the same workload by using CPU and GPU.

For GPU the target will be the Tesla P80

The tests are inspired by this article: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/accelerated-spark-on-gpu-enabled-clusters-in-azure/
